                    The Sims 4 is the fourth installment in The Sims franchise. Like the previous games in the series,
                    The Sims 4 focuses on creating and controlling a neighborhood of virtual people, called "Sims". The
                    Sims 4 features an overhauled and intuitive Create a Sim, updated building tools, new traits, and
                    the addition of emotions.<br>

                    The Sims 4 was released for PC in North America on September 2, 2014,[4] and in other places
                    worldwide shortly thereafter. A Mac version of the game was announced at the same time but was
                    released several months after the PC version on February 17, 2015.[7] The Console versions of The
                    Sims 4 for Xbox One and PlayStation 4 were released on November 17, 2017.[8] This is the first time
                    that the full base game and content packs became available for consoles, unlike previous iterations
                    in which alternate, limited versions of the game were used.<br>

                    The Sims 4 base game was announced to be free-to-play on September 14, 2022,[9] and became
                    available for free download on October 18, 2022, following the Behind The Sims Summit live stream
                    and the subsequent announcement of Project Rene, which is speculated to be the successor to the game
                    by the community.[10]
